It's the hellish project that nearly all web devs experience at one point. Hopefully I can succeed in finishing it!

#### Thoughts

- Could lean more on the fazerdaze / savbrown style for imagery
- I think chapters would have some simple animation styles
- Make name heading scramble text
- Add some drafting / blue print style margins to the page?
- make it look like space? pixel style representation of space. simple pixels, star pixels, glowing effects.
- 3D gifs look a bit out of place...
- Could also do a blue sky background image with a slightly noisy filter. (Like in that porter music video)

#### TODO

- [x] Get links working
- [ ] Add tab styling
- [x] Plan out / add images and gifs (thinking of adding cycling resolution gifs of the sun / moon / old film photos of the horizon / sunset)
- [ ] Add projects (NextJS app, NodeJS app, Creative stuff)
- [ ] Improve content display (headings and sub headings font sizes, spacing between sections)
