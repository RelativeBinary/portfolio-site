It's the hellish project that nearly all web devs experience at one point. Hopefully I can succeed in finishing it!

#### TODO
- Could lean more on the fazerdaze / savbrown style for imagery
- I think chapters would have some simple animation styles
- Make name heading scramble text 
- Add some drafting / blue print style margins to the page?
