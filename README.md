It's the hellish project that nearly all web devs experience at one point. Hopefully I can succeed in finishing it!

#### Thoughts

- Could lean more on the fazerdaze / savbrown style for imagery
- I think chapters would have some simple animation styles
- Make name heading scramble text
- Add some drafting / blue print style margins to the page?
- make it look like space? pixel style representation of space. simple pixels, star pixels, glowing effects.

#### TODO

- Get links working
- Plan out / add images and gifs
- Add projects (NextJS app, NodeJS app, Creative stuff)
- Improve content display (headings and sub headings font sizes, spacing between sections)
